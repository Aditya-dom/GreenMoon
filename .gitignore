/*
This system finds all named entities that have an
image component and writes the image to a file.
The name of the file is based on the name of the
entity.

Image pixels are Vector3<f64>, so we need to clamp
and normalise these pixels to write them to an
8-bit per channel png.

Currently, thereâ€™s no restriction that only images
from cameras are written.
